        <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>HTML, CSS, Javascript:</h3>
            <p>The Flask application uses Bootstrap CSS and Javascript to style the HTML templates for aesthetics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>Database:</h3>
            <p>I used the SQLAlchemy Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to create the database for my project. The advantage of this is that it provides the flexibility to use different databases without changing the underlying Python code in the future if I wish to expand upon the project. In this project, I use SQLite for a simple database to record information about users and their blog posts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>Web-App Structure:</h3>
            <p>The web app is structured as a package. During the creation of my project, I encountered a Circular-import error. To resolve this, I restructured the project into a package called <code>cs50blog</code> with an <code>__init__.py</code> file inside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>Forms:</h3>
            <p>Flask-WTF with FlaskForm base class and wtforms library: The web-app uses the WTForms form-handling library in python to better manage formss using field classes like "StringField", "BooleanField" etc. It also allows me to use useful methods like "validate_on_submit() to check if the information input into the forms are valid. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3>Session Management and Password hashing:</h3>
            <p>I use flask-login and its methods to manage users logging in and out, and manage user sessions. In addition, I use flask-bcrypt to encrypt passwords.</p>
